# Script for install linux kernel on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed

If you are using OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, and encounter an error like `Cannot find LILO.` when installing your manually built kernel by `make install`, you can drop this `installkernel` script into `/sbin`. This script was extracted from the deleted file of [this commit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openSUSE/dracut/e5fc2048dc7c6db9bb4f916bf88db7425b923ce4/suse/dracut-installkernel). See [the thread in OpenSUSE mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/PT4JALJ4AYNCWO2AOWRUCHVO4YELB3LK/) for more information.
